              <div class="panel">
                <p>The food was typically european (please consider that this was at the vipassana center in Germany). Or shall we say a vegetarian version of ordinary european food. For example: Jacket potatoes, roasted veggies, soups, pasta. The food seemed to be vegan with dairy products on the side (like cheese and sauce). We were also served some very mildly spiced tofu and curry dishes. Overall there were always lots of side dishes and toppings and bread you could pimp your food with.
                  For breakfast they served porridge (oats) and different bread with lots of different spreads.
                  You only eat two meals per day, and it was really easy to get adjused to the lack of dinner. Anyway, intermittent fasting is good for you, right?
                  The aquintance who took the course in India, said the food was typically Indian.

              <div class="panel">
                <p>At the meditation hall you can borrow blankets and cushions. I had read somewhere
                  about blankets, so I thought I was clever to bring one, however that was not necessary since
                  you could borrow there. The space in my suitcase would have used more efficiently if I had packed more
                  clothes, I kept thinking, before I tried to have no craving to the clothes still back home.
                  If you have some special cushions or meditation bench you could bring them.
                  The information we got was that we should bring a torch. However I (N) forgot mine, and in the end I wasn't missing
                  it. The pathways were all illuminated. We were also asked to bring an alarm clock. Cellphones were not allowed.
                  I found it rather difficult to find one in the brick and mortar stores on the last minute... Misstake number one...
                  Misstake number two was that I didn't read the
                  instructions before hand so when I got there I did not know how to use the alarm function.
                  Since I was recovering from a cold and generally need to sleep alot the breaks were often spent napping. I would have been more
                  at ease if I knew how to set the alarm. In the end I didn't oversleep, though. link to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Travel-Alarm-Clock-Operation/dp/B01KYLOVGI/ref=zg_bs_108321011_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=K2CR7V3YAAS4BYQBBEZX">alarm clock</a>

                    For me (Y) I thought that a torch was good to have. If you wake up at night, you could check the time without disturbing the roommates.
                    Also when you get up and the others are still in bed you can use the torch to find your stuff and the door.<BR>

                    <div class="panel">
                      <p>At the meditation hall there were lots of different cushions. It might be an advantage if you have
                        some sort of idea how to use them, or how you sit. I had no clue, people rushed to the cupboard with
                        all the stuff and grabbed what they needed. I on the other hand had on the first day no idea of how
                        and what to use. You can of course move (atleast the first days). <BR>
                          For people with special needs it was also possible to get chairs to sit on.

                            This is the type of cushion I got to meditate after I got back from the center (N). <BR>

                                A lot of people seemed to have been at some kind of turning point in their lives. Changing careers
                                and jobs. From beeing employees to going solo. Were in the process of finding out what kind of job they
                                wanted to do. Or going back to school. I found it all very interesting and exciting. So many brave people!

                                Before the course I had real concerns about the one hour sessions where you are not suppose to move. I even thought
                                that you would be thrown out of the course if you moved. That was not the case, and in the end
                                I even kind of prefered those sessions. Overall I found the course both more difficult and easier than I had imagined.

                                  have a shared accomondation, since I thought I might feel lonely if staying all by myself. Even if I wasn't allowed to speak to
                                  anyone (and really you should not even look at the others) I liked having people around. We were four people in one room and several

                                <p>After the course you are asked to make a donation if the course was helpful for you. The donation is that you pay
                                  for another student so to speak. It was not checked in anyway how much you donated. They had bank slipsfor differen t centers
                                  you could take with you as well as a table with a cardreader if you wanted to pay directly there. There were neither a pressure
                                  on how much to donate nor was there a followup on how much you donated.
